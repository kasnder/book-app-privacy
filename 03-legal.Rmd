# Legal Requirements

This chapter shall briefly summarise *your obligations* under EU Data Protection Legislation (GDPR) when sharing apps *in non-legal terms*.

If you have app users from the European Union, you are responsible for personal data collected through your app. Personal data is data relating to individuals. This may include device data, pseudonyms, user identifiers, advertising identifiers, (dynamic) IP addresses, and postcodes, especially in combination with other data. For these reasons, it is usually not possible to make personal data non-personal.

You are also responsible for personal data collected from your app for third-party services, such as advertising, analytics, or crash reporting services.

**Risk evaluation and documentation.** GDPR acknowledges that there will never be full protection of personal data. Instead, it encourages a risk-based approach, that is, seriously analysing the possible risks to data protection and taking appropriate data protection measures. If you can prove that you took all appropriate measures, there is no need to be overly afraid of high fines.

Make sure that you can provide such proof, by *documenting all data protection considerations, decisions, and actions*.

**Reasonable data collection.** You and your third-parties may only collect personal data reasonably, that is, only for the purposes stated in your privacy policy (purpose limitation) and restricted to what is necessary for the stated purposes (data minimisation).

Furthermore:

- *iOS:* According the Apple’s terms, you should ask for user consent, before you or your third-parties collect *any data*, no matter if personal and non-personal.
  *Android:* According to Google’s terms, if you process sensitive data (e.g. health-related), or process data in unexpected ways, do tell the user in a clear manner and ask for his *consent* (no pre-ticked boxes allowed).
- At best, use at most one third-party service for one purpose, that is, at most one advertising, analytics, and crash reporting service.
- Check with every app release, if you can reduce data collection or remove any third-party services.
- Verify the default settings of your third-party services (on-device and server-wise), since third-parties have an interest in collecting ever more data. Only activate third-party services, once user consent is established. More information can be found in the Appendix below.
- If your app is aimed at *children*, do not employ any third-party services. It’s not good practice, and a violation of Apple’s terms.

**Always provide a privacy policy.** Provide a privacy policy on the app store and within the app. You may want to use one of the privacy policy generators, such as [iubenda.com](https://gdpr4devs.com/iubenda.com). Make sure it discloses the data collection of you and your third-parties adequately.

**Handling user requests.** The GDPR entitles users to manage (e.g. access, delete, correct) any data about them. You can implement these user rights directly in software, which would show your efforts towards GDPR compliance. Yet, taking requests via email seriously is just as fine. You have one month to respond to user requests. This response may either address the request, or, for complex user requests, request an extension for a further 2 months.

**Security measures and data breaches.** Take the standard measures for security, such as HTTPS communications, salted passwords, validation of user inputs. Apple ([here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security) and [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide)) and [Google](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips) provide comprehensive guidance on this. Try to remove identifiable information whenever possible, through pseudonymisation or anonymisation. If you experience a *personal data breach*, you must notify [the data protection authority](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members) within 72 hours, plus the individuals in case of high risk.

**Consent for third-party services.** If you use third-party services, the user must be asked for consent in almost all circumstances. This consent must be sought before the third-party service is activated and begins to share data. Beyond consent, the Appendix below provides more detail on the correct implementation of the most widely used third-party services.

**Closing remarks.** By implementing these measures, you should come an important step closer to compliance with GDPR. Additionally, you should consult the guidelines of an EU data protection authority. The British Data Protection Authority, called ICO, provides [excellent guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/) on data protection.

## Methodology behind these guidelines

These legal guidelines shall cover the fundamentals of GDPR. These are 1) the key concepts, 2) user rights, and 3) principles and obligations. Legal terminology shall be avoided, to make the guidelines understandable without expert knowledge.

### Key concepts

The app developer shall be made aware of what GDPR protects, that is, *personal data*. Personal data is relevant for the developer, being responsible for its protection as the *data controller*. There has been much public attention on the *high penalties*, introduced by GDPR. The risk of such penalties is low, if the developer follows a *risk-based approach* to data protection, as advocated by GDPR.

### User rights

Not all developers will be aware of the profound rights, that GDPR grants to users. These shall be mentioned.

### Principles and obligations

The rest of the document shall cover the seven principles of GDPR, that the developer must follow as data controller:

- Lawfulness, fairness and transparency,
- Purpose limitation,
- Data minimisation,
- Accuracy,
- Storage limitation,
- Security, and
- Accountability.

To cover the first principle, “lawfulness, fairness and transparency”, the most important step is the provision of an adequate *privacy policy*. There exist rich online resources, which shall be mentioned.

For simplicity, the principles “purpose limitation”, “data minimisation”, “accuracy”, and “storage limitation” shall be summarised as *reasonable data collection*. The term “reasonable” is similarly used in the GDPR and occurs widely across the GDPR document, 52 times.

Regarding data collection, the further provisions of the platform providers, Apple and Google, shall be added.

The remaining principles of “security” and “accountability” shall be mentioned. Regarding security, Apple and Google provide support documents, that shall be linked.
