# About the author

I am a current PhD student at the Computer Science Department of Oxford University. My research interest lies in data protection in smartphone apps and the regulation of tech companies. I am developing *TrackerControl*, an Android app that shows you what companies track your app usage, and allows you to limit this.
Further, I enjoy discussing all things technical on my blog. These experiences have motivated summarising my experiences in this short book.
