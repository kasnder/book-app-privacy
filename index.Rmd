# Preface {-}

Nice that you found your way here. Privacy in apps is a super hot topic. What does this mean for me as an Android developer?

Surprisingly, there is very few information out there. I, myself, am an app developer, and spent hours browsing on the web. 'How do I do privacy right' is the question that this book want to address.

# About the Author {-}

Konrad is a current PhD student at the Computer Science Department of Oxford University. His research interest lies in data protection in smartphone apps and the regulation of tech companies. He is developing *TrackerControl*, an Android app that shows you what companies track your app usage, and allows you to limit this. Further, he enjoys discussing all things technical on my blog. These experiences have motivated this  short book.
