It’s an honour that you found your way here. Privacy in apps is an important topic. But, what does this mean for me as an Android developer? Surprisingly, there is very few information out there. This is true even though the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe’s flagship data protection law, was introduced in May 2018 – quite a while back. I, myself, have been an app developer for many, and spent hours browsing on the web to find out about how to comply. ‘How do I do privacy in apps right?’ is thus the question that this book seeks to address.
